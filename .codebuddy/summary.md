# Project Summary

## Overview of Technologies Used
This project is a Python-based bot designed to interact with the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange. The following languages, frameworks, and libraries are utilized:

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Aiogram (for building Telegram bots)
  - Aiohttp (for asynchronous HTTP requests)
- **Main Libraries**:
  - Pybit (for interacting with the Bybit API)
  - Pydantic (for data validation and settings management)
  - Aiofiles (for asynchronous file handling)
  - Websocket (for real-time communication)

## Purpose of the Project
The main purpose of this project is to create a Telegram bot that interacts with the Bybit trading platform, allowing users to perform various trading operations and receive updates directly through Telegram. The bot leverages asynchronous programming to handle multiple requests efficiently.

## Build and Configuration Files
The following files are relevant for the configuration and building of the project:

1. `/.gitignore`
2. `/requirements.txt`
3. `/config.py`
4. `/bybit_api_user.py`
5. `/main.py`

## Source Files Location
The source files can be found in the following directories:

- `/handlers`: Contains handler files for different commands.
- `/keyboards`: Contains keyboard layout files for the bot.
- `/state`: Contains state management files for the bot.

## Documentation Files Location
Documentation files are typically located in the root directory or within a dedicated `docs` folder. However, in this project structure, there are no explicit documentation files provided. The primary documentation can be inferred from the code comments and the README file if it exists, but it is not listed in the provided structure. 

For further details, users may need to refer to the code itself or any external documentation related to the libraries used, such as Aiogram and Pybit.
